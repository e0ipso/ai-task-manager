# End-to-End Hook Validation

## Objective
Perform complete end-to-end testing of the git commit workflow to ensure all hooks execute successfully without errors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full commit workflow completes successfully
- [ ] Pre-commit hook runs and passes (tests)
- [ ] Commit-msg hook runs and validates message
- [ ] No hook errors or failures occur
- [ ] Commit is successfully created

## Technical Requirements
- Perform actual git commit with valid commit message
- Verify pre-commit hook executes tests successfully
- Verify commit-msg hook validates message format
- Confirm commit completes without errors
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Input Dependencies
- Working commitlint validation from Task 3
- Clean test execution from Task 6
- Validated hook dependencies from Task 7
- Functional git repository with hooks

## Output Artifacts
- Confirmed working git commit workflow
- Successful commit demonstrating fix
- Documented test results and validation

## Implementation Notes
- Test with both valid and invalid commit messages
- Verify hook execution order and timing
- Document any remaining issues or limitations
- Create test commit to demonstrate functionality
- Consider CI/CD environment compatibility

## Test Results Summary
- Pre-commit hook executes and runs tests as expected
- Commit-msg hook validates conventional commit format correctly
- Hook chain execution works properly (pre-commit â†’ commit-msg)
- End-to-end workflow functions correctly with proper commit message format
