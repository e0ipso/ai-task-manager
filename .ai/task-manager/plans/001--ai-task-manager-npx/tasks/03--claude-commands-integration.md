## Objective
Implement the system to copy Claude Code command files from the NPX package to the target repository's .claude/commands/tasks directory.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All command files from /workspace/.claude/commands/tasks embedded in package
- [ ] Command file copying functionality implemented
- [ ] Target .claude/commands/tasks directory created if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Proper file permissions set on copied command files
- [ ] Validation that all commands are copied successfully

## Technical Requirements
- Copy generate-tasks.md and create-plan.md command files
- Maintain exact file structure and permissions
- Handle existing .claude directory or create if missing
- Preserve command file metadata and frontmatter
- Cross-platform directory creation and file copying

## Input Dependencies
- Basic project structure from Task 001
- Access to command files from current workspace

## Output Artifacts
- Command file management module
- Claude commands copying utilities
- Directory structure validation functions
- Command installation verification system

## Implementation Notes
- Store command files in commands/ directory within package
- Use recursive directory creation for .claude/commands/tasks path
- Validate command files have proper frontmatter structure
- Provide confirmation of successful command installation
- Handle edge cases where .claude directory exists but is not writable
