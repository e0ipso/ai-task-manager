## Objective
Implement comprehensive unit testing for all CLI functionality, file operations, and user interaction flows to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all core modules with >80% coverage
- [ ] Mock file system operations for safe testing
- [ ] CLI functionality testing with various inputs
- [ ] User interaction flow testing
- [ ] Error condition and edge case testing

## Technical Requirements
- Use Jest as the primary testing framework
- Implement proper mocking for file system operations
- Test CLI argument parsing and command execution
- Mock external dependencies (inquirer, fs operations)
- Provide test utilities for common testing patterns

## Input Dependencies
- Complete init command implementation from Task 007

## Output Artifacts
- Comprehensive test suite in tests/ directory
- Mock utilities for file system operations
- CLI testing helpers and fixtures
- Test configuration and setup files
- Code coverage reporting setup

## Implementation Notes
- Use Jest's built-in mocking capabilities for fs operations
- Create test fixtures for template files and expected outputs
- Test both success and failure scenarios thoroughly
- Implement integration tests for the complete init flow
- Set up continuous testing with appropriate npm scripts
