## Objective
Integrate all components into a complete init command implementation that orchestrates the entire setup process from CLI invocation to successful installation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Init command orchestrates all setup operations in correct sequence
- [ ] Proper error handling and rollback for failed operations
- [ ] Interactive and non-interactive modes work seamlessly
- [ ] Complete end-to-end functionality from CLI to file installation
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and user feedback throughout process

## Technical Requirements
- Coordinate CLI interface, user interaction, and file operations
- Implement proper error propagation and handling
- Support both interactive prompts and automated execution
- Provide detailed feedback on each step of the installation
- Handle edge cases and error conditions gracefully

## Input Dependencies
- CLI interface development from Task 004
- User interaction system from Task 005
- File system operations from Task 006

## Output Artifacts
- Complete init command implementation
- End-to-end error handling system
- Integration testing ready functionality
- Complete user experience flow
- Installation orchestration module

## Implementation Notes
- Use dependency injection or similar pattern for testability
- Implement comprehensive error handling with cleanup
- Provide clear progress indicators for each step
- Ensure atomic operations where possible
- Log all operations for debugging purposes
