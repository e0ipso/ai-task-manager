## Objective
Create a robust template management system that embeds template files within the NPX package and handles file copying with proper error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Template files embedded in the package structure
- [ ] File copying utilities with error handling implemented
- [ ] Directory structure preservation during copy operations
- [ ] Support for template file validation before copying
- [ ] Proper handling of file permissions and cross-platform compatibility

## Technical Requirements
- Use Node.js fs/promises for async file operations
- Implement proper error handling for file system operations
- Support for both TASK_MANAGER_INFO.md and VALIDATION_GATES.md templates
- Maintain original file structure when copying
- Handle existing file conflicts gracefully

## Input Dependencies
- Basic project structure from Task 001
- Access to template files from current workspace

## Output Artifacts
- Template management module (src/templates/)
- File copying utilities with error handling
- Template validation functions
- Cross-platform file operation support

## Implementation Notes
- Store templates in templates/ directory within the package
- Use path.join() for cross-platform path handling
- Implement checksums or file validation for template integrity
- Consider using fs.copyFile() for efficient file copying
- Provide detailed error messages for failed operations
