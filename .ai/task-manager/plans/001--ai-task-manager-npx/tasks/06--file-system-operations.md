## Objective
Develop safe and reliable file system operations for checking existing installations, creating directory structures, and validating successful installation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Existing installation detection and conflict handling
- [ ] Safe directory structure creation with proper permissions
- [ ] File copying operations with validation
- [ ] Installation verification and rollback capability
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility for all file operations

## Technical Requirements
- Implement safe directory creation with proper error handling
- File existence checking before copying operations
- Atomic operations where possible to prevent partial installations
- Proper file permission handling across platforms
- Installation validation to confirm all files copied correctly

## Input Dependencies
- Template system implementation from Task 002
- Claude commands integration from Task 003

## Output Artifacts
- File system operations module (src/filesystem/)
- Installation validation utilities
- Conflict detection and resolution system
- Cross-platform compatibility layer
- Rollback functionality for failed installations

## Implementation Notes
- Use fs.promises for all async file operations
- Implement proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Consider using temporary directories for atomic operations
- Validate file integrity after copying (checksums)
- Provide options for conflict resolution (overwrite, merge, skip)
