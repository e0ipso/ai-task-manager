# Recursive Decomposition and Iteration Controls Test Suite

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing for the recursive decomposition functionality and iteration controls in the enhanced generate-tasks.md template. These tests validate the safety mechanisms, convergence monitoring, and quality controls that prevent infinite loops and ensure meaningful task breakdown.

## Test Suite 1: Basic Decomposition Iteration Testing

### Test 1.1: Single Iteration Success
**Objective**: Validate tasks that decompose successfully in one iteration

**Test Case**: Medium-high complexity task
```yaml
Original Task: "Implement user dashboard with analytics charts and real-time data"

Initial Complexity Assessment:
  Technical Depth: 6 (React components, charting libraries, WebSocket)
  Decision Complexity: 5 (chart type selection, data visualization decisions)
  Integration Points: 6 (API integration, real-time updates, UI components)
  Scope Breadth: 6 (complete dashboard feature)
  Uncertainty Level: 4 (standard implementation patterns)
  Composite Score: 6.6 → REQUIRES DECOMPOSITION
```

**Expected Single Iteration Decomposition**:
```yaml
Iteration 1 Results:
  Subtask 1: "Create dashboard layout and navigation structure"
    Composite Score: 3.8 (UI focused, clear requirements)
  
  Subtask 2: "Implement analytics charts with Chart.js integration"
    Composite Score: 4.5 (charting library integration)
  
  Subtask 3: "Add real-time data updates with WebSocket connection"
    Composite Score: 4.2 (WebSocket implementation)
  
  Subtask 4: "Create data aggregation and formatting utilities"
    Composite Score: 3.6 (utility functions)

All subtasks ≤5 → DECOMPOSITION COMPLETE
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Original task correctly identified as needing decomposition
- [ ] Single iteration produces all subtasks ≤5 composite score
- [ ] No further iteration triggered
- [ ] Dependencies correctly established between subtasks
- [ ] Skill assignments remain focused (1-2 skills per task)

### Test 1.2: Two-Iteration Decomposition
**Objective**: Test tasks requiring multiple decomposition rounds

**Test Case**: High complexity with mixed complexity subtasks
```yaml
Original Task: "Build multi-tenant SaaS platform with tenant isolation, billing integration, and admin console"

Initial Complexity Assessment:
  Technical Depth: 8 (multi-tenancy architecture, complex integrations)
  Decision Complexity: 8 (tenant isolation strategy, billing model decisions)
  Integration Points: 8 (multiple external systems, complex data flows)
  Scope Breadth: 9 (complete platform architecture)
  Uncertainty Level: 7 (architectural decisions, scaling requirements)
  Composite Score: 9.0 → REQUIRES DECOMPOSITION
```

**Expected Iteration 1**:
```yaml
Iteration 1 Results:
  Subtask 1: "Design and implement tenant isolation architecture"
    Composite Score: 6.8 → STILL NEEDS DECOMPOSITION
  
  Subtask 2: "Integrate billing system with Stripe/payment processing"

    Composite Score: 4.9 → ACCEPTABLE
  
  Subtask 4: "Implement tenant onboarding and provisioning workflow"
    Composite Score: 4.3 → ACCEPTABLE
```

**Expected Iteration 2**:
```yaml
Subtask 1 Decomposition:
  1a: "Design database schema for tenant isolation (row-level security)"
    Composite Score: 4.1 → ACCEPTABLE
  
  1b: "Implement middleware for tenant context switching"
    Composite Score: 4.4 → ACCEPTABLE
  
  1c: "Create tenant-aware API routing and authentication"
    Composite Score: 4.7 → ACCEPTABLE

Subtask 2 Decomposition:

  2b: "Create billing webhook handlers and payment processing"
    Composite Score: 4.2 → ACCEPTABLE
  
  2c: "Build usage tracking and metering system"
    Composite Score: 4.8 → ACCEPTABLE

Final Task Count: 7 tasks, all ≤5 composite score
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] First iteration correctly identifies tasks needing further decomposition
- [ ] Second iteration successfully reduces all remaining high-complexity tasks
- [ ] Iteration limit tracking properly maintained
- [ ] Dependencies correctly restructured across iterations
- [ ] Total iteration count ≤3 respected

### Test 1.3: Maximum Iteration Limit Test
**Objective**: Validate hard limit enforcement and escalation procedures

**Test Case**: Task resistant to decomposition
```yaml
Original Task: "Develop novel quantum computing algorithm for optimization problems with formal verification and hardware-specific optimizations"

Complexity Analysis:
  Technical Depth: 10 (cutting-edge quantum algorithms)
  Decision Complexity: 9 (novel algorithmic decisions)
  Integration Points: 6 (quantum hardware, classical systems)
  Scope Breadth: 7 (complete algorithm development)
  Uncertainty Level: 10 (research-level uncertainty)
  Composite Score: 11.0 → MANDATORY DECOMPOSITION
```

**Expected Iteration Sequence**:
```yaml
Iteration 1:
  Subtask A: "Research quantum optimization algorithms and select approach"
    Score: 8.5 → NEEDS FURTHER DECOMPOSITION
  Subtask B: "Implement core quantum algorithm logic"
    Score: 7.2 → NEEDS FURTHER DECOMPOSITION
  Subtask C: "Add formal verification framework"
    Score: 6.8 → NEEDS FURTHER DECOMPOSITION

Iteration 2:
  Subtask A remains complex due to research nature → Score: 7.9
  Subtask B shows minimal improvement → Score: 6.9
  Subtask C achieves acceptable complexity → Score: 4.8

Iteration 3 (FINAL ATTEMPT):
  Subtask A minimal improvement → Score: 7.1
  Subtask B minimal improvement → Score: 6.3
  Both still >5 after maximum iterations

EXPECTED RESULT: ESCALATION
```

**Expected Escalation Documentation**:
```yaml
status: "needs-clarification"
complexity_score: 7.1
complexity_notes: |
  Original complexity: 11.0 → Iteration 1 → [8.5, 7.2, 6.8] → 
  Iteration 2 → [7.9, 6.9, 4.8] → Iteration 3 → [7.1, 6.3, 4.8]
  
  Task complexity remains high after maximum decomposition attempts.
  Requires senior architect review - inherent complexity exceeds 
  decomposition capabilities. Recommend breaking into separate 
  research phase and implementation phase at project planning level.
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Maximum 3 iterations enforced strictly
- [ ] Escalation triggered when tasks remain >5 after max iterations
- [ ] Proper escalation documentation generated
- [ ] Iteration history tracked accurately
- [ ] Manual intervention clearly recommended

## Test Suite 2: Convergence Monitoring and Loop Prevention

### Test 2.1: Convergence Failure Detection
**Objective**: Test detection when decomposition doesn't meaningfully reduce complexity

**Test Case**: Task with inherent indivisible complexity
```yaml
Original Task: "Optimize machine learning model hyperparameters using genetic algorithms with multi-objective optimization"

Iteration Tracking:
Round 1: Score 8.2 → Subtasks: [7.8, 6.1, 5.9]
Round 2: Score 7.8 → Subtasks: [7.5, 6.8] (minimal improvement)
Round 3: Score 7.5 → Subtasks: [7.2, 7.0] (minimal improvement)

Convergence Analysis:
- Round 1→2: Improvement = 0.3 points (acceptable)
- Round 2→3: Improvement = 0.3 points (minimal)
- Round 3: No subtask <6.0 (no meaningful progress)
```

**Expected Behavior**:
```yaml
Convergence Monitoring Result:
- DETECTION: "Task shows decomposition resistance - manual review required"
- ACTION: Stop decomposition, mark as needs-clarification

- ESCALATION: Flag for senior architect review
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Convergence failure accurately detected
- [ ] Decomposition stopped before maximum iterations when no progress
- [ ] Proper documentation of convergence failure
- [ ] Manual review flags appropriately set

### Test 2.2: Oscillation Prevention
**Objective**: Prevent decomposition attempts that increase complexity

```yaml
Original Task: "Create unified API authentication system supporting OAuth2, SAML, and custom tokens"

Problematic Decomposition Attempt:
Round 1: Score 6.5 → Attempted Subtasks: [7.1, 6.8, 5.2]
Issue: First two subtasks became MORE complex due to integration overhead

Expected Prevention:
- DETECTION: "Decomposition increasing complexity detected"
- ACTION: Reject decomposition, keep original task
- ALTERNATIVE: Try different decomposition pattern
- FALLBACK: Mark as needs-clarification if no viable decomposition
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Complexity increases detected and prevented

**Test Case**: Task with multiple skill domains
```yaml
Original Task: "Build full-stack e-commerce checkout with payment processing and inventory management"

Skills: ["react-components", "api-endpoints", "database", "payment-processing"]
Issue: >2 skills indicates over-complexity

Expected Decomposition Along Skill Boundaries:
Iteration 1:
  Subtask 1: "Create checkout UI components and form validation"
    Skills: ["react-components"] → 1 skill (good)
  
  Subtask 2: "Implement payment processing API with Stripe integration"
    Skills: ["api-endpoints", "payment-processing"] → 2 skills (acceptable)
  
  Subtask 3: "Add inventory management and stock checking"
    Skills: ["database", "api-endpoints"] → 2 skills (acceptable)
  
  Subtask 4: "Integrate frontend checkout with backend APIs"
    Skills: ["react-components"] → 1 skill (good)
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Original >2 skills triggers decomposition
- [ ] Subtasks maintain skill coherence (≤2 skills each)
- [ ] Skills align with actual task requirements
- [ ] No skill conflicts or unclear assignments

### Test 3.2: Scope Preservation Validation
**Objective**: Ensure decomposed tasks collectively match original scope

**Test Case**: Risk of scope expansion during decomposition
```yaml
Original Task: "Add user profile editing with avatar upload"
Original Scope: Basic profile editing functionality

Problematic Decomposition (Scope Creep):
- Add comprehensive user preferences system ❌ (out of scope)
- Implement advanced image editing features ❌ (out of scope)
- Create user activity history tracking ❌ (out of scope)

Correct Decomposition (Scope Preserved):
- Create profile editing form UI ✅
- Implement avatar upload and validation ✅
- Add profile update API endpoint ✅
- Integrate form with backend API ✅
```

**Expected Scope Validation**:
```yaml
Scope Check Process:
1. Compare subtask collective scope to original requirements
2. Flag any subtasks not explicitly mentioned in original task
3. Remove or merge out-of-scope elements
4. Document scope validation in complexity_notes
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Scope preservation check applied during each iteration
- [ ] Out-of-scope elements identified and removed
- [ ] Subtasks collectively equal (not exceed) original scope
- [ ] Scope validation documented in complexity_notes

## Test Suite 4: Dependency Reconstruction During Iterations

### Test 4.1: Dependency Chain Preservation
**Objective**: Maintain logical dependency relationships through decomposition

**Test Case**: Task chain with dependencies
```yaml
Original Dependencies:
Task A: "Design database schema" (Score: 3.2) → No decomposition needed
Task B: "Implement API endpoints" (Score: 6.8, depends on A) → Needs decomposition
Task C: "Create frontend integration" (Score: 4.1, depends on B) → No decomposition needed

Task B Decomposition:
B1: "Create user management API endpoints" (depends on A)
B2: "Implement product catalog API endpoints" (depends on A)
B3: "Add order processing API endpoints" (depends on A, B1, B2)

Expected Dependency Reconstruction:
- Task A → B1, B2 (B1 and B2 can run in parallel after A)
- B1, B2 → B3 (B3 needs both user and product APIs)
- B3 → Task C (C needs complete API implementation)
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Dependencies correctly redistributed to subtasks
- [ ] Logical dependency relationships preserved
- [ ] Parallel execution opportunities identified
- [ ] No circular dependencies introduced

### Test 4.2: Complex Dependency Web Management
**Objective**: Handle complex dependency scenarios during decomposition

**Test Case**: Multiple interdependent tasks being decomposed
```yaml
Original Complex Dependencies:
Task X (Score: 7.5) → depends on nothing
Task Y (Score: 6.9) → depends on X  
Task Z (Score: 8.2) → depends on X, Y

All three need decomposition, creating complex dependency web

Expected Management:
1. Decompose Task X first (no dependencies)
2. Update Task Y dependencies to reference X subtasks
3. Decompose Task Y with updated dependencies
4. Update Task Z dependencies to reference both X and Y subtasks  
5. Decompose Task Z with complete dependency picture
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Decomposition order follows dependency chain
- [ ] Dependencies updated after each decomposition
- [ ] Complex dependency webs handled correctly
- [ ] All final dependencies reference valid tasks

5. Document correction in complexity_notes
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Complexity scoring inconsistencies detected
- [ ] Automatic re-evaluation attempted
- [ ] Corrected scores align with task descriptions

### Test 5.2: Resource Constraint Handling
**Objective**: Manage decomposition when it creates resource contention

**Test Case**: Task requiring specialized knowledge
```yaml
Original Task: "Implement cryptographic security protocols for financial transactions"
Complexity: Requires specialized security expertise

Problematic Decomposition:
- Multiple subtasks all requiring rare security expertise
- Creates resource contention (single security expert needed for all)
- Doesn't improve parallelization potential

Expected Handling:
1. Detect that decomposition doesn't improve resource utilization
2. Consider keeping as single complex task with detailed implementation notes
3. Alternative: Decompose into research + implementation phases
4. Document resource constraint considerations
```

**Validation Criteria**:
