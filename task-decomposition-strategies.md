# Task Decomposition Strategies and Patterns

## Overview

This document provides systematic approaches for breaking down complex tasks (complexity score >5) into manageable subtasks while preserving dependencies and maintaining task coherence. The strategies build upon the five-dimensional complexity scoring algorithm to create targeted decomposition patterns.

## Core Decomposition Principles

### 1. Complexity-Driven Decomposition
Each decomposition pattern targets specific complexity drivers:
- **High Technical Depth**: Split by technology/framework boundaries
- **High Decision Complexity**: Separate decision-making from implementation
- **High Integration Points**: Isolate integration concerns from core functionality
- **High Scope Breadth**: Divide by functional or user story boundaries
- **High Uncertainty**: Separate research/clarification from execution

### 2. Atomic Task Boundaries
Decomposed tasks must maintain:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each task addresses one primary concern
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicit input/output relationships
- **Skill Focus**: Maximum 2 complementary skills per task
- **Measurable Completion**: Concrete acceptance criteria

### 3. Dependency Preservation
When decomposing tasks, maintain referential integrity:
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Clear predecessor/successor relationships
- **Parallel Streams**: Independent tasks that can run concurrently
- **Resource Dependencies**: Shared components or data requirements
- **Knowledge Dependencies**: Information flow between tasks

## Decomposition Workflow: The AIDVR Process

### Phase A: Assessment
**Objective**: Identify primary complexity drivers requiring decomposition

**Steps**:
1. **Score Calculation**: Apply complexity scoring algorithm
2. **Trigger Evaluation**: 
   - Composite score ≥ 6: Consider decomposition
   - Any dimension ≥ 8: Mandatory decomposition
   - Multiple dimensions ≥ 6: High decomposition candidate
3. **Driver Analysis**: Identify which dimensions drive the high complexity
4. **Decomposition Feasibility**: Verify task can be meaningfully split

**Decision Point**: Proceed if composite score ≥ 6 AND task can be atomically divided

### Phase I: Identification
**Objective**: Map task components and natural breakpoints

**Steps**:
1. **Component Mapping**: List all major task components
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify relationships between components  
3. **Skill Assessment**: Catalog required skills for each component
4. **Boundary Detection**: Find natural separation points
5. **Constraint Identification**: Note components that must remain together

**Output**: Component map with potential separation boundaries

### Phase D: Decomposition Strategy Selection
**Objective**: Choose appropriate decomposition pattern based on complexity drivers

**Pattern Selection Matrix**:

| Primary Driver | Secondary Driver | Pattern | Example |
|----------------|------------------|---------|---------|
| Technical Depth | Any | Technology Layering | Split API integration from UI implementation |
| Decision Complexity | Integration Points | Decision-Implementation Split | Architecture decisions → Implementation tasks |
| Integration Points | Scope Breadth | Integration Isolation | Core feature → Integration tasks |
| Scope Breadth | Technical Depth | Functional Decomposition | User stories → Technical components |
| Uncertainty | Any | Research-Implementation Split | Research spike → Implementation tasks |

### Phase V: Validation
**Objective**: Verify decomposition maintains task integrity and reduces complexity

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Each subtask complexity score ≤ 5 (target ≤ 4)
- [ ] All original requirements covered by subtasks
- [ ] Dependencies clearly defined and achievable
- [ ] No circular dependencies created
- [ ] Each subtask has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Skills required per subtask ≤ 2
- [ ] Resource allocation remains reasonable

**Re-decomposition Triggers**:
- Any subtask still scores >5
- Missing functionality in decomposition
- Circular dependencies detected
- Subtasks require >2 skills each

### Phase R: Reconstruction
**Objective**: Rebuild dependency graph and validate referential integrity

**Steps**:
1. **Dependency Mapping**: Create explicit predecessor/successor links
2. **Parallel Path Identification**: Mark tasks that can run concurrently
3. **Resource Coordination**: Identify shared resources and coordination points
4. **Integration Planning**: Define how subtasks will be integrated
5. **Validation Sequence**: Plan testing and validation order

## Decomposition Patterns Library

### Pattern 1: Technology Layering
**Use When**: High Technical Depth (≥7), multiple technologies/frameworks involved

**Strategy**: Split tasks along technology boundaries, creating clear interface points

**Template**:
```
Original Task: [Complex multi-technology task]
→ Subtask A: [Technology 1 components]
→ Subtask B: [Technology 2 components]  
→ Subtask C: [Integration between Tech 1 and Tech 2]
→ Subtask D: [Testing across technology boundaries]
```

**Example**:
```
Original: "Implement real-time chat with WebSocket backend and React frontend"
→ Task 1: Design and implement WebSocket server architecture
→ Task 2: Create React chat UI components
→ Task 3: Integrate WebSocket client with React state management
→ Task 4: End-to-end testing of real-time communication
```

**Dependency Pattern**: Sequential → Parallel → Integration → Validation

### Pattern 2: Decision-Implementation Split
**Use When**: High Decision Complexity (≥7), significant architectural choices required

**Strategy**: Separate decision-making tasks from implementation tasks

**Template**:
```
Original Task: [Task requiring major decisions]
→ Subtask A: Research and analyze options for [decision area]
→ Subtask B: Document decision rationale and architecture
→ Subtask C: Implement core functionality based on decisions
→ Subtask D: Implement secondary features using established patterns
```

**Example**:
```
Original: "Design and implement scalable user permission system"
→ Task 1: Research permission patterns (RBAC, ABAC, hierarchical)
→ Task 2: Design permission architecture and data model
→ Task 3: Implement core permission checking infrastructure
→ Task 4: Implement user interface for permission management
```

**Dependency Pattern**: Research → Design → Core Implementation → Feature Implementation

### Pattern 3: Integration Isolation
**Use When**: High Integration Points (≥7), multiple external systems involved

**Strategy**: Isolate core functionality from integration concerns

**Template**:
```
Original Task: [Task with multiple integration points]
→ Subtask A: Implement core feature in isolation
→ Subtask B: Create integration adapters for System 1
→ Subtask C: Create integration adapters for System 2
→ Subtask D: Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms
→ Subtask E: Integration testing across all systems
```

**Example**:
```
Original: "Implement user analytics with database, Redis, and external tracking"
→ Task 1: Design and implement analytics data model
→ Task 2: Create database persistence layer
→ Task 3: Implement Redis caching integration
→ Task 4: Integrate with external tracking service (Google Analytics)
→ Task 5: End-to-end analytics pipeline testing
```

**Dependency Pattern**: Core → Parallel Integrations → Error Handling → Testing

### Pattern 4: Functional Decomposition
**Use When**: High Scope Breadth (≥7), multiple user workflows or features involved

**Strategy**: Split along functional or user story boundaries

**Template**:
```
Original Task: [Broad feature with multiple user workflows]
→ Subtask A: [User workflow 1]
→ Subtask B: [User workflow 2]
→ Subtask C: [Shared/common functionality]
→ Subtask D: [Integration and consistency validation]
```

**Example**:
```
Original: "Implement comprehensive order management system"
→ Task 1: Create order placement workflow
→ Task 2: Implement order tracking and updates
→ Task 3: Build order cancellation and refund process
→ Task 4: Develop shared order data models and validations
→ Task 5: Integration testing across all order workflows
```

**Dependency Pattern**: Common Infrastructure → Parallel Workflows → Integration Testing

### Pattern 5: Research-Implementation Split
**Use When**: High Uncertainty (≥7), significant unknowns or experimental work

**Strategy**: Separate research/clarification from implementation work

**Template**:
```
Original Task: [Task with significant unknowns]
→ Subtask A: Research and prototype [unknown area 1]
→ Subtask B: Research and prototype [unknown area 2]
→ Subtask C: Document findings and implementation approach
→ Subtask D: Implement solution based on research
→ Subtask E: Validate solution meets original requirements
```

**Example**:
```
Original: "Optimize application performance (specific targets TBD)"
→ Task 1: Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
→ Task 2: Research optimization techniques for identified bottlenecks
→ Task 3: Define specific performance targets based on findings
→ Task 4: Implement high-impact optimizations
→ Task 5: Validate performance improvements meet targets
```

**Dependency Pattern**: Parallel Research → Synthesis → Implementation → Validation

### Pattern 6: Hybrid Decomposition
**Use When**: Multiple high dimensions (≥2 dimensions scoring ≥7)

**Strategy**: Combine patterns based on the specific complexity profile

**Selection Rules**:
1. **Primary Pattern**: Choose based on highest-scoring dimension
2. **Secondary Adaptations**: Modify based on second-highest dimension
3. **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Add tasks for dimensions scoring ≥6

**Example**:
```
Task: "Build distributed microservices architecture" 
(Technical: 9, Decisions: 8, Integration: 8, Scope: 7, Uncertainty: 7)

Combined Pattern (Technology Layering + Decision-Implementation):
→ Task 1: Research microservices patterns and service boundaries
→ Task 2: Design overall system architecture and communication patterns  
→ Task 3: Implement core service framework and shared libraries
→ Task 4: Implement individual microservices (parallel subtasks)
→ Task 5: Implement service-to-service communication
→ Task 6: Implement monitoring and observability
→ Task 7: End-to-end integration and performance testing
```

## Dependency Reconstruction Rules

### Rule 1: Sequential Dependency Preservation
When decomposing tasks with sequential dependencies:
- Maintain predecessor-successor relationships
- Ensure output artifacts from predecessors match input requirements of successors
- Add intermediate validation tasks if dependency gaps exist

### Rule 2: Parallel Stream Creation
When tasks can be parallelized:
- Identify truly independent tasks (no shared mutable resources)
- Mark parallel streams in dependency graph
- Plan synchronization points for parallel stream integration

### Rule 3: Resource Conflict Resolution
When subtasks share resources:
- Make resource dependencies explicit
- Plan resource access sequencing
- Consider resource abstraction layers to reduce coupling

### Rule 4: Knowledge Flow Management
When tasks depend on knowledge/decisions from other tasks:
- Make knowledge transfer points explicit
- Document required information exchanges
- Plan knowledge validation checkpoints

## Validation Rules and Stop Conditions

### Minimum Task Viability Criteria

**DO NOT decompose further if any condition is met**:

1. **Atomic Boundary**: Task cannot be meaningfully split without losing coherence
2. **Skill Coherence**: Decomposition would create tasks requiring <1 skill or fragmented knowledge
3. **Overhead Burden**: Decomposition creates more coordination overhead than execution benefit  
4. **Resource Fragmentation**: Subtasks would require same resources but create access conflicts
5. **Time Granularity**: Subtasks would each take <2 hours (too granular for planning)

### Complexity Validation

**Target Complexity Scores for Decomposed Tasks**:
- **Ideal Range**: 2-4 complexity score
- **Acceptable Range**: 1-5 complexity score  
- **Maximum Allowed**: 5 complexity score
- **Re-decomposition Trigger**: >5 complexity score

### Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing decomposition:
- [ ] **Coverage**: All original requirements covered by subtasks
- [ ] **Coherence**: Each subtask has clear, single purpose
- [ ] **Completeness**: Dependencies explicitly defined and achievable
- [ ] **Consistency**: Task complexity reduced without losing functionality
- [ ] **Clarity**: Each subtask has measurable acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Coordination**: Integration plan exists for subtask outputs

### Common Decomposition Anti-Patterns

**Avoid These Mistakes**:

1. **Over-Granularization**: Creating tasks too small to be meaningful
2. **False Independence**: Splitting tasks that share too many dependencies
3. **Skill Fragmentation**: Requiring same expertise across multiple tiny tasks
4. **Artificial Boundaries**: Splitting at technical conveniences rather than logical boundaries
5. **Dependency Cycles**: Creating circular dependencies between subtasks
6. **Resource Competition**: Multiple subtasks competing for same constrained resource
7. **Integration Gaps**: Decomposing without clear plan for reassembly

## Integration with Task Management Templates

### Template Integration Points

These decomposition strategies should be embedded in the `generate-tasks.md` template as:

1. **Complexity Assessment**: Reference complexity scoring algorithm for >5 scores
2. **Pattern Selection**: Use decision matrix to choose appropriate decomposition pattern
3. **Decomposition Execution**: Apply chosen pattern with validation steps
4. **Dependency Reconstruction**: Use dependency rules to maintain referential integrity
5. **Quality Validation**: Apply stop conditions and quality checklist

### Template Enhancement Sections

**For generate-tasks.md template**:
- Add complexity scoring step before task generation
- Include pattern selection decision tree
- Add decomposition validation checklist
- Include dependency preservation rules
- Add re-analysis triggers for tasks still scoring >5

**For execute-blueprint.md template**:
- Add complexity awareness for current task selection
- Include dependency validation before task execution
- Add guidance for handling decomposed task integration

This systematic approach ensures that complex tasks are reliably broken down into manageable components while maintaining the integrity and coherence of the overall development effort.
