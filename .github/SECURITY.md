# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security standards and procedures for the AI Task Manager CLI tool. Security is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline to ensure that vulnerabilities are detected and addressed promptly.

## Automated Security Scanning

### npm Audit Integration

The CI/CD pipeline includes automated dependency vulnerability scanning using npm audit:

- **Frequency**: Every pull request and release
- **Scope**: All production and development dependencies
- **Thresholds**: 
  - ❌ **Critical vulnerabilities**: Block PR merge
  - ❌ **High vulnerabilities**: Block PR merge
  - ⚠️ **Moderate vulnerabilities**: Warning, no block
  - ℹ️ **Low vulnerabilities**: Informational only

### GitHub Security Advisories

Integration with GitHub's Security Advisory database:

- Checks against known vulnerabilities in the npm ecosystem
- Provides additional context and remediation guidance
- Automatically updated with the latest security information

### Security Scan Process

1. **Cache Optimization**: Leverages existing npm dependency caching for performance
2. **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive vulnerability reports
3. **PR Comments**: Automatically comments on PRs with security findings
4. **Artifact Storage**: Security scan results stored for 30 days
5. **Performance Metrics**: Tracks scan duration and cache effectiveness

## Vulnerability Management

### Severity Levels and Response

| Severity | Response Time | Action Required |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Critical | Immediate | Block deployment, immediate fix required |
| High | 24-48 hours | Block deployment, fix before merge |
| Moderate | 1 week | Monitor and plan fix |
| Low | 1 month | Monitor and consider fix |

### Remediation Process

1. **Automatic Fixes**: Try `npm audit fix` first
2. **Manual Review**: For complex vulnerabilities requiring manual intervention
3. **Dependency Updates**: Update to secure versions when available
4. **Alternative Packages**: Consider replacements if no fix available
5. **Risk Assessment**: Document accepted risks for unavoidable vulnerabilities

## Commands for Developers

### Local Security Scanning

```bash
# Run security audit locally
npm audit

# Attempt automatic fixes
npm audit fix

# Force fixes (may introduce breaking changes)
npm audit fix --force

# Generate detailed report
npm audit --json > audit-report.json
```

### Checking Specific Packages

```bash
# Check specific package for vulnerabilities
npm audit --package=<package-name>

# View package security information
npm view <package-name> security
```

## Security Best Practices

### Development Guidelines

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `npm ci` in production environments
   - Review dependency changes in pull requests
   - Minimize dependency footprint

2. **Code Security**:
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Avoid eval() and similar dynamic code execution
   - Use TypeScript for type safety

3. **Environment Security**:
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD credentials

### CI/CD Security

1. **Automated Scanning**: All changes go through security validation
2. **Artifact Verification**: Build artifacts are validated before release
3. **Dependency Pinning**: Use exact versions in package-lock.json
4. **Regular Updates**: Automated dependency update checks

## Reporting Security Issues

### Internal Security Issues

For security issues in our codebase:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Use the "Security" label for public issues
2. **Private Reports**: Email maintainers for sensitive issues
3. **Pull Requests**: Include security impact in PR descriptions

### External Vulnerabilities

For vulnerabilities in dependencies:

1. **Automated Detection**: CI/CD will catch most issues
2. **Manual Reporting**: Report to dependency maintainers
3. **CVE Database**: Check CVE database for known issues

## Security Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring

- **Daily**: Automated dependency checks in CI/CD
- **Weekly**: Review security scan artifacts and trends
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive security review and updates
- **Quarterly**: Security policy and procedure review

### Metrics and Reporting

The CI/CD pipeline tracks:
- Number of vulnerabilities by severity
- Time to fix vulnerabilities
- Security scan performance metrics
- Cache hit rates for security scanning

### Integration Points

1. **GitHub Actions**: Automated security scanning in workflows
2. **Dependabot**: Automated dependency update PRs
3. **GitHub Security Tab**: Centralized security overview
4. **npm Registry**: Official package vulnerability database

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards

- **OWASP**: Follow OWASP guidelines for application security
- **npm Security**: Adhere to npm security best practices
- **GitHub Security**: Leverage GitHub's security features

### Audit Trail

All security-related activities are logged:
- CI/CD security scan results
- Manual security fixes and updates
- Security policy changes
- Incident response actions

## Emergency Response

### Critical Vulnerability Response

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate impact and exposure
2. **Hotfix Development**: Create fix branch and emergency patch
3. **Testing**: Rapid testing of security fix
4. **Deployment**: Emergency deployment to affected environments
5. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of security issue and resolution

### Incident Documentation

All security incidents are documented with:
- Timeline of discovery and response
- Impact assessment and affected systems
- Root cause analysis
- Remediation steps taken
- Lessons learned and process improvements
