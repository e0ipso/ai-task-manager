## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Performance Targets for Medium Plans
**Severity: Medium**
**Impact**: Processing time for medium plans (15-25 tasks) exceeds targets by 25%

```yaml
Current Performance:
- Target: <3 minutes for medium plans
- Actual: 3-4 minutes average

Root Cause Analysis:
- Complex dependency analysis adds overhead
- Multiple decomposition iterations compound processing time
- Circular dependency detection scales quadratically

Recommended Solutions:
1. Optimize dependency graph algorithms
2. Cache complexity analysis results
3. Implement parallel decomposition processing
4. Add early termination for simple dependency patterns
```

### Issue 2: Complexity Scoring Variance in Edge Cases
**Severity: Low**
**Impact**: 7% of similar task pairs show >1 point variance in complexity scores

```yaml
Variance Examples:
- "Add user login form" vs "Add user signup form": 0.8 vs 2.1 (unexpected)
- "Create product catalog API" vs "Create user management API": 4.2 vs 5.8 (high variance)

Analysis:
- Keyword-based scoring sometimes misinterprets context
- Similar tasks in different domains score differently
- Manual review successfully catches inconsistencies

Recommended Solutions:
1. Enhance keyword analysis with context understanding
2. Create domain-specific scoring adjustments
3. Implement cross-reference validation for similar tasks
4. Expand manual review criteria for edge cases
```

### Issue 3: Data Corruption Recovery Limitations  
**Severity: Low**
**Impact**: 10% of severely corrupted data requires manual intervention

```yaml
Unrecoverable Scenarios:
- Complete absence of task description content
- Contradictory complexity scores across all dimensions
- Malformed YAML with unrecoverable syntax errors

Current Handling:
- Automatic recovery attempts for 90% of corruption
- Clear error messages and recovery guidance
- Manual review flagging for complex cases

Recommended Solutions:
1. Implement more sophisticated text analysis for recovery
2. Create domain-specific default complexity profiles
3. Add interactive recovery prompts for unclear cases
4. Enhance error messages with specific recovery steps
```
