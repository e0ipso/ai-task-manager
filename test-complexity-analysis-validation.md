# Enhanced Generate-Tasks Template: Complexity Analysis Test Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive testing for the enhanced generate-tasks.md template to validate the complexity analysis workflow and ensure all success criteria from Plan 18 Task 005 are met. The testing covers complexity scoring, recursive decomposition, dependency integrity, and edge case handling.

## Test Objectives

Validate the success criteria from Plan 18:
- **Complexity Constraint Enforcement**: 100% of final tasks have complexity scores ≤5
- **Functional Preservation**: All existing functionality remains operational  
- **Dependency Integrity**: Task dependency graphs remain consistent
- **Consistency Validation**: Complexity scores are consistent across similar tasks
- **Decomposition Effectiveness**: Complex tasks broken into 2-4 simpler subtasks

## Testing Methodology

Following "meaningful testing" principles, this test plan focuses on:
- Core functionality validation with real scenarios
- Integration testing of the full complexity analysis workflow
- Edge case testing for error handling and safety controls
- Backward compatibility verification
- Performance and usability validation
