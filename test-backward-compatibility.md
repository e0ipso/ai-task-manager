# Backward Compatibility Test Suite

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing to ensure the enhanced generate-tasks.md template maintains full backward compatibility with existing functionality. These tests validate that all previous features work unchanged while new complexity analysis features are added seamlessly.

## Test Suite 1: Legacy Template Functionality Preservation

### Test 1.1: Basic Task Generation Unchanged
**Objective**: Verify standard task generation works exactly as before

**Test Case**: Simple plan that should not trigger complexity analysis
```yaml
Legacy Plan Example:
---
id: legacy-test-plan
summary: Simple website updates
created: 2024-09-06
---

# Website Enhancement Plan

## Objectives
Update the contact page with new information and styling.

## Requirements
1. Update contact information text
2. Adjust styling to match brand colors
3. Test changes across browsers
4. Deploy updates to production

Expected Tasks (Pre-Enhancement):
- Task 1: Update contact page text content
- Task 2: Apply brand color styling updates  
- Task 3: Perform cross-browser testing
- Task 4: Deploy changes to production
```

**Expected Behavior (Post-Enhancement)**:
```yaml
Generated Tasks Should Remain Identical:
Task 1:
  id: 1
  group: "content-updates"
  dependencies: []
  status: "pending"
  created: "2024-09-06"
  skills: ["html"]
  # No complexity_score (≤5, not documented)
  # No complexity_notes (not needed)

Task 2:
  id: 2
  group: "styling"
  dependencies: [1]
  status: "pending" 
  created: "2024-09-06"
  skills: ["css"]

Task 3:
  id: 3
  group: "testing"
  dependencies: [2]
  status: "pending"
  created: "2024-09-06"
