# Dependency Graph Integrity Test Suite

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing for dependency graph integrity during the complexity analysis and decomposition process in the enhanced generate-tasks.md template. These tests ensure that task dependencies remain logically consistent, acyclic, and valid throughout all decomposition operations.

## Test Suite 1: Circular Dependency Detection and Prevention

### Test 1.1: Simple Circular Dependency Detection
**Objective**: Detect basic circular dependencies in task graphs

**Test Case**: Three-task circular dependency
```yaml
Original Dependency Structure:
Task A: "Create user authentication API" → No dependencies
Task B: "Implement user profile management" → Depends on A
Task C: "Add user activity logging" → Depends on B

Problematic Circular Introduction:
If Task A gets modified to depend on Task C → Creates cycle: A → C → B → A

Expected Detection:
Graph Validation Process:
1. Build adjacency list: {A: [C], B: [A], C: [B]}
2. Run cycle detection algorithm (DFS-based)
3. Detect cycle: A → C → B → A
4. Identify shortest cycle and critical edge to remove
5. Automatically correct by removing least critical dependency
```

**Expected Resolution**:
```yaml
Cycle Detection Result:
- CYCLE FOUND: [A, C, B, A]
- CRITICAL EDGE ANALYSIS:
  - A → C: High criticality (main workflow dependency)
  - C → B: Medium criticality (logging needs profile data)
  - B → A: Low criticality (artificial/incorrect dependency)
- AUTO-CORRECTION: Remove B → A dependency
- RESULT: Acyclic graph restored

Final Dependencies:
Task A: No dependencies ✅
Task B: Depends on A ✅
Task C: Depends on B ✅
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Circular dependency accurately detected
- [ ] Critical edge analysis correctly identifies removal candidate
- [ ] Auto-correction preserves logical workflow
- [ ] Resulting graph is acyclic
- [ ] Affected tasks marked for review with documentation

### Test 1.2: Complex Multi-Path Circular Dependencies
**Objective**: Handle complex circular dependencies with multiple cycles

**Test Case**: Complex dependency web with multiple potential cycles
```yaml
Original Complex Structure:
Task A: Database Schema → No dependencies
Task B: API Layer → Depends on A
Task C: Frontend Components → Depends on B
Task D: Integration Tests → Depends on C
Task E: Performance Optimization → Depends on D
Task F: Monitoring Setup → Depends on E
Task G: Documentation → Depends on B, F

Problematic Additions Creating Multiple Cycles:
- Task B modified to depend on Task G (creates B → G → F → E → D → C → B)
- Task A modified to depend on Task D (creates A → D → C → B → A)
```

**Expected Complex Cycle Detection**:
```yaml
Multi-Cycle Analysis:
Cycle 1: A → D → C → B → A (length: 4)
Cycle 2: B → G → F → E → D → C → B (length: 6)

Resolution Strategy:
1. Identify all cycles simultaneously
2. Prioritize shorter cycles for resolution
3. Find minimum edge set that breaks all cycles
4. Apply corrections with minimal workflow disruption

Optimal Edge Removal:
- Remove A → D (breaks Cycle 1 with minimal impact)
- Remove B → G (breaks Cycle 2, G can depend on final state)

Final Corrected Structure:
A (no deps) → B → C → D (no A dep) → E → F → G (deps: F only)
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] All cycles detected in complex graphs
- [ ] Optimal edge removal minimizes workflow disruption
- [ ] Multi-cycle resolution handled correctly
- [ ] Final graph maintains logical task progression
- [ ] All corrections documented with rationale

### Test 1.3: Self-Dependency Edge Case
**Objective**: Handle tasks that incorrectly depend on themselves

**Test Case**: Task with self-reference
```yaml
Problematic Task:
Task X: "Implement user authentication with session management"
Dependencies: [X] (self-reference)

Expected Detection and Correction:
1. Self-dependency detected during validation
2. Auto-correction: Remove self-reference
3. Result: Task X with no dependencies
4. Documentation: "Self-dependency removed - task cannot depend on itself"
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Self-dependencies detected immediately
- [ ] Auto-correction removes self-references
- [ ] No impact on other task dependencies
- [ ] Clear documentation of correction applied

## Test Suite 2: Dependency Reconstruction During Decomposition

### Test 2.1: Simple Dependency Redistribution
**Objective**: Correctly redistribute dependencies when tasks are decomposed

**Test Case**: Single task with dependencies being decomposed
```yaml
Original Structure:
Task A: "Database Setup" → No dependencies
Task B: "API Implementation" (Score: 6.8) → Depends on A
Task C: "Frontend Integration" → Depends on B

Task B Decomposition:
B1: "Create API endpoint structure" → Should depend on A
B2: "Implement business logic" → Should depend on B1
B3: "Add error handling and validation" → Should depend on B2

Expected Dependency Reconstruction:
Original: A → B → C
Reconstructed: A → B1 → B2 → B3 → C

Validation Points:
- A → B1: Correct (API structure needs database)
- B1 → B2: Correct (business logic needs endpoints)
- B2 → B3: Correct (error handling needs core logic)
- B3 → C: Correct (frontend needs complete API)
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Original dependencies correctly distributed to subtasks
- [ ] New internal dependencies between subtasks are logical
- [ ] Downstream tasks correctly updated to reference final subtask
- [ ] No orphaned or missing dependencies created

### Test 2.2: Multiple Dependent Tasks Decomposition
**Objective**: Handle scenarios where multiple interconnected tasks are decomposed

**Test Case**: Multiple tasks with cross-dependencies being decomposed
```yaml
Original Complex Structure:
Task X: "User Management System" (Score: 7.2) → No dependencies
Task Y: "Order Processing System" (Score: 6.9) → Depends on X
Task Z: "Reporting Dashboard" (Score: 8.1) → Depends on X, Y

All three tasks need decomposition, creating complex dependency reconstruction

Task X Decomposition:
X1: "User registration and authentication" → No dependencies
X2: "User profile management" → Depends on X1  
X3: "User permissions and roles" → Depends on X2

Task Y Decomposition:
Y1: "Order creation and validation" → Depends on X3 (needs user permissions)
Y2: "Payment processing integration" → Depends on Y1
Y3: "Order fulfillment workflow" → Depends on Y2

Task Z Decomposition:
Z1: "Data aggregation layer" → Depends on X2, Y3 (needs user data and orders)
Z2: "Report generation engine" → Depends on Z1
Z3: "Dashboard UI components" → Depends on Z2
```

**Expected Final Dependency Graph**:
```yaml
Reconstructed Dependencies:
X1 → X2 → X3 → Y1 → Y2 → Y3
      ↓              ↓
     Z1 ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
      ↓
     Z2 → Z3

Validation:
- All original relationships preserved
- New internal dependencies logical
- No circular dependencies introduced
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Multi-task decomposition handled correctly
- [ ] Cross-dependencies preserved and enhanced appropriately
- [ ] Logical progression maintained throughout
- [ ] Parallel execution paths correctly identified

### Test 2.3: Dependency Chain Optimization
**Objective**: Optimize dependency chains for maximum parallelization

**Test Case**: Long serial dependency chain with parallelization opportunities
```yaml
Original Serial Chain:
A → B → C → D → E → F (all tasks dependent on previous)

After Decomposition Analysis:
A: Database schema (Score: 3.2) → No decomposition needed
B: API Layer (Score: 6.5) → Decompose into B1, B2, B3
C: Frontend (Score: 4.1) → No decomposition needed  
D: Testing (Score: 6.8) → Decompose into D1, D2
E: Deployment (Score: 3.9) → No decomposition needed
F: Monitoring (Score: 4.5) → No decomposition needed

Optimization Opportunities:
B1, B2 can run in parallel after A
D1 can start after B1 (doesn't need full API)
C can start after B2 (doesn't need B3)
```

**Expected Optimized Structure**:
```yaml
Parallel Execution Phases:
Phase 1: A
Phase 2: B1, B2 (parallel after A)
Phase 3: B3 (after B1, B2), C (after B2), D1 (after B1)
Phase 4: D2 (after D1), continued frontend work
Phase 5: E (after all API and frontend complete)
Phase 6: F (after deployment)

Optimization Results:
- Original critical path: 6 sequential steps
- Optimized critical path: 6 phases with parallelization
- Estimated time reduction: ~30% through parallel execution
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Parallelization opportunities identified correctly
- [ ] Dependencies remain logically sound
- [ ] Critical path length maintained or reduced
- [ ] Phase-based execution plan generated accurately

## Test Suite 3: Orphaned Task Prevention and Recovery

### Test 3.1: Missing Dependency Detection
**Objective**: Identify and resolve tasks with non-existent dependencies

**Test Case**: Task referencing deleted or invalid dependencies
```yaml
Problematic Scenario:
Task A: "Frontend Integration" → Depends on Task 99 (doesn't exist)
Task B: "Data Processing" → Depends on Task "legacy-system" (invalid ID format)

Expected Detection Process:
1. Validate all dependency IDs against existing task list
2. Identify missing or invalid references
3. Determine resolution strategy for each case
4. Apply corrections or flag for manual review
```

**Expected Resolution Strategies**:
```yaml
Resolution Options:
1. Missing Numeric ID (Task 99):
   - Check if task was decomposed (find replacement subtasks)
   - Create placeholder task if within scope
   - Mark as needs-clarification if out of scope

2. Invalid ID Format ("legacy-system"):
   - Search for similar task names/descriptions
   - Suggest closest match for manual review
   - Create placeholder with best-guess requirements

Auto-Resolution Results:
Task A: Updated to depend on discovered subtasks [87, 88] (Task 99 was decomposed)
Task B: Marked needs-clarification with suggested dependency options
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] All dependency references validated against task registry
- [ ] Missing dependencies detected accurately
- [ ] Appropriate resolution strategies applied
- [ ] Manual review flagged when auto-resolution not possible

### Test 3.2: Decomposition-Created Orphans
**Objective**: Prevent decomposition from creating unachievable dependencies

**Test Case**: Decomposition that invalidates dependent tasks
```yaml
Original Structure:
Task X: "Database Operations" → No dependencies
Task Y: "API Endpoints" → Depends on X
Task Z: "Error Handling" → Depends on Y

Task Y Decomposition Creates Issue:
Y1: "User API endpoints"
Y2: "Product API endpoints" 
Y3: "Order API endpoints"

Problem: Task Z depends on "Y" but Y no longer exists
Resolution Needed: What should Z depend on?
```

**Expected Dependency Reconstruction Logic**:
```yaml
Dependency Reconstruction Rules:
1. If dependent task needs ALL subtasks: depend on final subtask (Y3)
2. If dependent task needs ANY subtask: depend on first appropriate (Y1)
3. If dependent task needs SPECIFIC functionality: depend on relevant subtask

For Error Handling Task Z:
Analysis: Error handling applies to all API endpoints
Resolution: Z depends on [Y1, Y2, Y3] (all subtasks needed)
Alternative: Z depends on Y3 only (if Y3 represents integration completion)
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Decomposition impact on dependent tasks analyzed
- [ ] Appropriate dependency reconstruction rules applied
- [ ] Logical workflow progression maintained
- [ ] No orphaned tasks created during decomposition

### Test 3.3: Cross-Plan Dependencies
**Objective**: Handle dependencies that reference external plans or tasks

**Test Case**: Task with dependencies outside current plan scope
```yaml
Cross-Plan Dependency Scenario:
Current Plan: "Frontend Enhancement" 
Task A: "Add user dashboard" → Depends on "backend-user-api" from different plan

Expected Handling:
1. Identify external dependency references
2. Validate external task exists and is achievable
3. Document cross-plan coordination requirements
4. Flag for project management review if needed
```

**Expected Documentation**:
```yaml
Cross-Plan Dependency Documentation:
Task A Dependencies:
- Internal: [] (no internal dependencies)
- External: ["Plan-15::Task-23 (backend-user-api)"]
- Coordination Required: Ensure Plan 15 Task 23 completion before starting Task A
- Risk Assessment: External dependency creates scheduling risk
- Mitigation: Verify Plan 15 timeline alignment
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Cross-plan dependencies identified and documented
- [ ] Coordination requirements clearly specified
- [ ] Scheduling risks properly flagged
- [ ] External task references validated where possible

## Test Suite 4: Dependency Validation During Error Conditions

### Test 4.1: Malformed Dependency Data Recovery
**Objective**: Handle corrupted or malformed dependency information

**Test Case**: Tasks with invalid dependency data formats
```yaml
Malformed Dependency Examples:
Task A: dependencies: "Task B" (string instead of array)
Task B: dependencies: [null, undefined, ""] (invalid elements)
Task C: dependencies: ["Task-X", 999, "invalid"] (mixed invalid formats)

Expected Data Sanitization:
Task A: dependencies: [] (cleared invalid format, flagged for review)
Task B: dependencies: [] (null/undefined/empty removed)
Task C: dependencies: [999] (valid numeric ID preserved, invalid strings removed)
```

**Expected Error Recovery Process**:
```yaml
Data Sanitization Steps:
1. Validate dependency array format
2. Filter out null/undefined/empty values
3. Validate each dependency ID format and existence
4. Document corrections applied
5. Flag sanitized tasks for manual review

Recovery Documentation:
"Dependency data sanitized - removed invalid entries: [list]
Manual review recommended to restore intended dependencies"
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Malformed dependency data detected and sanitized
- [ ] Invalid entries removed without affecting valid ones
- [ ] Data corrections documented for audit trail
- [ ] Manual review flagged for sanitized tasks

### Test 4.2: Dependency Conflicts During Decomposition
**Objective**: Resolve conflicts when decomposition creates contradictory dependencies

**Test Case**: Decomposition creating impossible dependency requirements
```yaml
Conflict Scenario:
Task A: "User Authentication" → Depends on []
Task B: "User Profile Display" → Depends on [A]

Task A Decomposed Into:
A1: "Login Form Implementation"
A2: "Session Management"  
A3: "Password Reset Flow"

Conflict: Task B actually only needs A1 (login), but automatic reconstruction 
         makes it depend on A3 (password reset) which is unnecessary

Expected Conflict Resolution:
1. Analyze what Task B actually needs from original Task A
2. Map requirement to appropriate subtask(s)
3. Update dependency to minimal required set
4. Document reasoning for dependency mapping
```

**Expected Resolution**:
```yaml
Dependency Analysis Result:
Task B: "User Profile Display"
Required from Task A: User authentication status only
Optimal Dependency: [A2] (session management provides auth status)
Reasoning: Profile display needs session validation, not login UI or password reset

Final Dependency: Task B → A2
Documentation: "Dependency optimized - profile display requires session management only"
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Dependency conflicts identified during decomposition
- [ ] Requirements analysis determines optimal dependencies
- [ ] Minimal necessary dependencies assigned
- [ ] Optimization reasoning documented clearly

## Test Suite 5: Advanced Dependency Scenarios

### Test 5.1: Conditional and Soft Dependencies
**Objective**: Handle optional or conditional task dependencies

**Test Case**: Tasks with optional performance optimizations
```yaml
Dependency Scenario:
Task A: "Core Feature Implementation" → No dependencies
Task B: "Performance Optimization" → Soft dependency on A (optional)
Task C: "Feature Testing" → Hard dependency on A, soft on B

Expected Dependency Classification:
Hard Dependencies: Must complete before dependent task can start
Soft Dependencies: Should complete for optimal execution, but not blocking

Dependency Notation:
Task C: 
  hard_dependencies: [A]
  soft_dependencies: [B]
  
Execution Rules:
- Task C can start after Task A completes
- Task C gets additional context/benefits if Task B also completes
- Task C proceeds without Task B if Task B is delayed
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Dependency types correctly classified
- [ ] Execution rules properly defined
- [ ] Soft dependencies don't create blocking conditions
- [ ] Optimal vs minimal execution paths identified

### Test 5.2: Resource-Constrained Dependencies
**Objective**: Handle dependencies based on shared resource constraints

**Test Case**: Tasks competing for limited specialized resources
```yaml
Resource Constraint Scenario:
Task A: "Security Audit Implementation" → Requires security expert
Task B: "Penetration Testing" → Requires same security expert  
Task C: "Security Documentation" → Requires same security expert

Resource Constraint: Only 1 security expert available
Logical Dependency: A → B → C (serial execution required despite no logical dependency)

Expected Resource-Based Dependency Analysis:
1. Identify shared resource requirements
2. Create resource-based ordering constraints
3. Document resource constraints in dependency rationale
4. Optimize for resource utilization efficiency
```

**Expected Resource Optimization**:
```yaml
Resource-Optimized Dependencies:
Sequence: A → B → C (serial due to shared resource)
Documentation: "Serial execution required - shared security expert resource"
Alternative: If security expert available part-time, tasks can overlap
Optimization: Combine related activities to maximize expert utilization efficiency
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Shared resource constraints identified
- [ ] Resource-based dependencies created appropriately
- [ ] Resource utilization optimized
- [ ] Constraint documentation provided
