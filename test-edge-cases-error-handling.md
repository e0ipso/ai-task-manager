## Test Suite 1: Infinite Loop Prevention and Recovery

### Test 1.1: Decomposition Resistance Detection
**Objective**: Test tasks that fundamentally resist meaningful decomposition

**Test Case 1**: Atomic but inherently complex task
```yaml
Task: "Optimize quantum decoherence mitigation in superconducting qubits"
Characteristics: 
- Fundamentally indivisible (quantum physics research)
- High complexity in multiple dimensions
- Cannot be simplified without losing scientific meaning

Complexity Analysis:
  Technical Depth: 10 (cutting-edge physics)
  Decision Complexity: 9 (novel research decisions)  
  Integration Points: 5 (hardware/software integration)
  Scope Breadth: 6 (focused but comprehensive research)
  Uncertainty Level: 10 (research-level unknowns)
  Composite Score: 11.0

Expected Decomposition Attempts:
Iteration 1: Attempted breakdown still yields high scores
  - Research current approaches (Score: 9.2)
  - Design mitigation strategies (Score: 8.8)
  - Implement and validate (Score: 8.5)

Iteration 2: Minimal improvement
  - Literature review (Score: 8.7) 
  - Theoretical modeling (Score: 8.3)
  - Experimental validation (Score: 8.1)

Iteration 3: Convergence failure
  - Still no meaningful reduction below 6.0 threshold

Expected Escalation:
- Status: needs-clarification
- Documentation: "Task complexity remains high after maximum decomposition attempts"
- Recommendation: "Requires senior architect review - inherent complexity exceeds decomposition capabilities"
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Decomposition resistance correctly identified
- [ ] Iteration limit enforced (maximum 3 attempts)
- [ ] Proper escalation documentation generated
- [ ] No infinite loop condition created

### Test 1.2: Oscillating Complexity Scores
**Objective**: Handle tasks where decomposition causes complexity to fluctuate

**Test Case**: Task with interdependent complexity factors
```yaml
Task: "Implement distributed consensus algorithm with byzantine fault tolerance"

Problematic Decomposition Pattern:
Round 1: Score 7.5 → Subtasks: [6.8, 6.2, 5.1]
Round 2: Subtask 1 (6.8) → Further decomposed: [7.1, 6.9] (complexity increased!)
Round 3: Subtask 2 (6.2) → Further decomposed: [6.0, 6.4] (minimal improvement)

Issue: Integration overhead causes complexity to increase when separated

Expected Detection and Resolution:
1. Detect complexity score increases after decomposition
2. Reject decomposition that increases complexity
3. Try alternative decomposition patterns
4. If no pattern works, mark as atomic complex task
```

**Expected Error Handling**:
```yaml
Oscillation Detection:
- Round 2: Complexity increase detected (6.8 → 7.1, 6.9)
- Action: Reject this decomposition, try different pattern
- Alternative: Decision-implementation split instead of technology layering
- Result: Keep as single complex task with detailed implementation notes

Documentation: "Decomposition rejected - integration overhead increases complexity"
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Complexity increases detected and prevented
- [ ] Alternative decomposition patterns attempted
- [ ] Fallback to atomic task when no viable decomposition
- [ ] Proper documentation of oscillation prevention

### Test 1.3: Stack Overflow Prevention
**Objective**: Prevent infinite recursion in decomposition logic

**Test Case**: Recursive decomposition trigger conditions
```yaml
Malicious/Broken Condition:
- Task complexity assessment creates circular logic
- Subtask generation triggers re-evaluation of parent
- Parent re-evaluation triggers subtask regeneration

Mock Scenario:
Task A (Score: 6.5) → Decompose → Subtasks B, C
Subtask B references Task A context → Triggers A re-evaluation  
A re-evaluation changes score → Triggers new decomposition
New decomposition affects B → Infinite cycle

Expected Protection Mechanisms:
1. Track decomposition stack depth
2. Prevent re-evaluation of tasks currently being decomposed
3. Limit maximum recursion depth to prevent stack overflow
4. Break cycles with timeout and error handling
```

**Expected Stack Protection**:
```yaml
Stack Protection Implementation:
- Maximum recursion depth: 10 levels
- Decomposition tracking: Set of tasks currently being processed
- Circular reference detection: Parent-child relationship validation
- Timeout mechanism: 30-second limit per task decomposition

Error Handling:
- Stack depth exceeded: "Decomposition stack overflow prevented"
- Circular reference: "Circular decomposition reference detected"
- Timeout: "Decomposition timeout - task marked for manual review"
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Stack overflow protection prevents system crashes
- [ ] Circular decomposition references detected and broken
- [ ] Timeout mechanisms prevent infinite processing
- [ ] Error conditions properly documented and escalated

2. Attempt to infer missing information from description
3. Apply default values where appropriate
4. Flag for manual review if critical information cannot be inferred
5. Continue processing with recovered data
```

**Expected Data Recovery**:
```yaml
Recovery Actions:
1. Complexity Assessment: Infer from description keywords
   - "implement" + "authentication" → Technical Depth: 5-6
   - Standard implementation → Decision Complexity: 4-5
   
2. Skill Inference: Extract from task context
   - "authentication" → ["authentication", "api-endpoints"]
   
3. Dependencies: Default to empty array, flag for review
   
4. Status: Default to "needs-clarification"

Recovery Documentation:
"Task data recovery applied - inferred complexity and skills from description.
Manual review recommended to validate assumptions."
```

**Test Case 2**: Corrupted complexity scores

- Decision Complexity: -5 (invalid negative value)
- Integration Points: 15 (exceeds maximum scale)
- Scope Breadth: null (null value)
- Uncertainty Level: undefined (undefined value)

Expected Sanitization:
- Non-numeric values → Convert to numeric or apply default
- Out-of-range values → Clamp to valid range (1-10)
- Null/undefined → Apply default based on task description
```

  Integration Points: 7 (inconsistent with single button)
  Scope Breadth: 1 (consistent)
  Uncertainty Level: 2 (consistent)

Skills: ["quantum-computing", "machine-learning"] (inconsistent with button text)

Expected Inconsistency Detection:
1. Analyze task description for complexity indicators
2. Compare stated complexity with description-implied complexity
3. Identify and flag significant discrepancies
4. Apply corrective measures or request clarification
```

**Expected Consistency Validation**:
```yaml
Inconsistency Analysis:
Description Analysis: "Simple text change" → Expected complexity 1-2 across all dimensions

Detected Inconsistencies:
- Technical Depth: 9 vs expected 1 (major discrepancy)
- Decision Complexity: 8 vs expected 1 (major discrepancy)  
- Skills: Quantum/ML vs expected ["html", "css"] (major discrepancy)

Auto-Correction Applied:
- Technical Depth: 9 → 1 (aligned with description)
- Decision Complexity: 8 → 1 (aligned with description)
- Skills: ["html"] (simple UI change)

```

**Validation Criteria**:

Expected Character Handling:
1. Preserve unicode characters in descriptions
2. Handle special symbols in technical contexts appropriately
3. Ensure character encoding doesn't break parsing
4. Generate valid identifiers from unicode descriptions
```

**Expected Processing Results**:

Task 2: Description preserved, ID generated: "implement-user-auth-system"  
Task 3: Mathematical symbols preserved in description, safe ID generated
Task 4: Code syntax preserved, proper escaping applied
