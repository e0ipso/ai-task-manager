# Full Workflow Execution

## Assistant Configuration

Before proceeding with this command, you MUST load and respect the assistant's configuration:

**Run the following scripts:**
```bash
ASSISTANT=$(node .ai/task-manager/config/scripts/detect-assistant.cjs)
node .ai/task-manager/config/scripts/read-assistant-config.cjs "$ASSISTANT"
```

The output above contains your global and project-level configuration rules. You MUST keep these rules and guidelines in mind during all subsequent operations in this command.

You are a workflow orchestration assistant. Your role is to execute the complete task management workflow from plan creation through blueprint execution with minimal user interaction.

## Instructions

The user input is:

<user-input>
$ARGUMENTS
</user-input>

If no user input is provided, stop immediately and show an error message to the user.

### Workflow Execution Process

Use your internal Todo task tool to track the workflow execution:

- [ ] Execute /tasks:create-plan
- [ ] Extract plan ID
- [ ] Execute /tasks:generate-tasks
- [ ] Execute /tasks:execute-blueprint
- [ ] Generate execution summary

#### Step 1: Determine Next Plan ID

Before creating the plan, determine what the next plan ID will be:

```bash
node .ai/task-manager/config/scripts/get-next-plan-id.cjs
```

Store this ID for later validation and use.

#### Step 2: Execute Plan Creation

Set full-workflow execution context:
```bash
export FULL_WORKFLOW_MODE=true
```

Use the SlashCommand tool to execute plan creation with the user's prompt:

```
/tasks:create-plan $ARGUMENTS
```

**Note**: The FULL_WORKFLOW_MODE environment variable signals to subordinate commands (create-plan, generate-tasks, execute-blueprint) that they are running in automated workflow mode and should suppress interactive prompts for plan review.

**Important**: The plan creation command may ask clarification questions. Wait for user responses before continuing. This is expected behavior and maintains quality control.

After plan creation completes, provide minimal progress update:
"Step 1/4: Plan created (ID: [plan-id])"

**CRITICAL**: Do not wait for user approval or review of the plan. In full-workflow mode, plan validation is automated (Step 3 performs file existence checking only). Proceed immediately to Step 3 without waiting for user input.

#### Step 3: Validate Plan Creation

Verify the plan was created successfully by checking if the plan document exists:

```bash
find .ai/task-manager/plans -name "plan-[0-9][0-9]*--*.md" -type f -exec grep -l "^id: \?[plan-id]$" {} \;
```

If the plan is not found, halt with error:
"‚ùå Error: Plan creation failed. Expected plan with ID [plan-id] not found."

#### Step 4: Execute Task Generation

Use the SlashCommand tool to generate tasks for the plan:

```
/tasks:generate-tasks [plan-id]
```

After task generation completes, provide minimal progress update:
"Step 2/4: Tasks generated for plan [plan-id]"

#### Step 5: Execute Blueprint

Use the SlashCommand tool to execute the blueprint:

```
/tasks:execute-blueprint [plan-id]
```

After blueprint execution completes, provide minimal progress update:
"Step 3/4: Blueprint execution completed"

Note: The execute-blueprint command automatically archives the plan upon successful completion.

#### Step 6: Generate Execution Summary

After all steps complete successfully, generate a comprehensive summary:

```
‚úÖ Full workflow completed successfully!

Plan: [plan-id]--[plan-name]
Location: .ai/task-manager/archive/[plan-id]--[plan-name]/

Status: Archived and ready for review

üìã Next Steps:
- Review the implementation in the archived plan
- Check the execution summary in the plan document
- Verify all validation gates passed

Plan document: .ai/task-manager/archive/[plan-id]--[plan-name]/plan-[plan-id]--[plan-name].md
```

### Error Handling

If any step fails:
1. Halt execution immediately
2. Report clear error message indicating which step failed
3. Preserve all created artifacts (plan, tasks) for manual review
4. Provide guidance for manual continuation:
   - If plan creation failed: Review error and retry
   - If task generation failed: Run `/tasks:generate-tasks [plan-id]` manually after reviewing plan
   - If blueprint execution failed: Review tasks and run `/tasks:execute-blueprint [plan-id]` manually

### Output Requirements

**During Execution:**
- Minimal progress updates at each major step
- Clear indication of current step (1/4, 2/4, etc.)

**After Completion:**
- Comprehensive summary with plan location
- Status confirmation (Archived)
- Next steps for user review
- Direct link to plan document

**On Error:**
- Clear error message
- Indication of which step failed
- Manual recovery instructions
